# Future updates and ideas

### Priority changes
- **Overhaul Game Over state:**: Remake the Game Over screen by letting the player save its last score with a name (no more than 10 chars). Maybe saving the minutes he spend playing. Keep it simple.
- **Leaderboard option:** New entry on the main menu Leaderboard to check the records. (Order by score and select name, time played, score). Keep it simple.
- **Animations:** Create animations for everything: main menu alien, bullets against rocks, bullets again powerups, rocks against the ship, destroyed spaceship.
- **Entire sound pallet:** Including main menu song, gameplay song, shooting, destroying rocks, picking powerups, damaging ship, game over sound (after spaceship exploded animation), switch between options sound and maybe a song for the credits.

### Optional
- **Nightmare mode:** All rocks aim towards the player.
- **Continue?:** Continue? screen after beated with 5 seconds cooldown to choose yes or no. Yes to reset no to go back to the main menu. **This is important**.
- **Score table:** Enable to register your name with your total points at the end of the game (maybe not posible between sesions cause inavility).
- **Secret level:** Develop secret lvl with key combo.
- **Ammo system:** Right now there's no punishment on holding the trigger constantly. Make "limited" ammo. If you hold the trigger ammo will decrease, but it restores itself overtime if you stop shooting, that way the game punishes us for holding the trigger too much time. If you only shoot single shots ammo doesn't decrease.
