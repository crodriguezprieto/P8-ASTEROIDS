# Future updates and ideas

### Visual changes
- **Animations:** Create animations for everything: destroyed rock, destroyed spaceship, game over cinematic.

### New Features
- **Entire sound pallet:** Including background sound, when shooting, when hit a rock, when spaceship explodes (background sound end), game over sound (after spaceship exploded animation), switch between menu selects sound.
- **New difficulty:** New setting change dificulty.
- **Score summary when game over:** Detailed summary when game is over: How many rocks you broke, how many shots shot, accuraccy ratio, time on the game (including all lives f.example)
- **Nightmare mode:** All rocks aim towards the player.
- **Continue?:** Continue? screen after beated with 5 seconds cooldown to choose yes or no. Yes to reset no to go back to the main menu. **This is important**.
- **Score table:** Enable to register your name with your total points at the end of the game (maybe not posible between sesions cause inavility).
- **Secret level:** Develop secret lvl with key combo. 

### Logic changes/add
- **Ammo system:** Right now there's no punishment on holding the trigger constantly. Make "limited" ammo. If you hold the trigger ammo will decrease, but it restores itself overtime if you stop shooting, that way the game punishes us for holding the trigger too much time. If you only shoot single shots ammo doesn't decrease.
